## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# R chunk with no name but multiple options (using ,)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
# R chunk with no name but options (not using,)
```

```{r, chunk_name}
# wrong R chunk with , and name is parsed as argument
```

```{sql, eval=FALSE}
/*A sql chunk chunk with no name but options*/
```

```{eval = TRUE}
A void code
```

```{}
Another void code
```

```
Still another void code
```

```a really strange inline block ```

``` {r}
a strange chuck header with space before {
```
