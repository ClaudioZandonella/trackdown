\section{R and \LaTeX}

This is an Rnw document. \LaTeX is a (\textit{not so}) simple formatting syntax for authoring PDF documents. For more details on using \LaTeX see \url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn}.

\Sexpr{sum(1:5)}

Multiple inline code \Sexpr{sum(1:5)} same line \Sexpr{"Hello World!!!"} to avooid greedy.

Tryng to mess up \LaTeX \\documentclass{ 
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this: \\begin{document}

<<cars>>= #some text
summary(cars)
@      

\section{Including Plots}

You can also embed plots, for example:

<<pressure, echo=FALSE>>=
plot(pressure)
@

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

<<echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE>>=
# R chunk with no name but multiple options (using ,)
3+3
@

<<echo=FALSE>>= # a really evil comment
# R chunk with no name but options (not using,)
@

<<sql, eval=FALSE>>=
/*A  wrong sql chunk chunk with no name but options*/
@

<<>>=
# A void code block
@
